CPSC 362 - Group C
Our project is a user review website that focuses on video games. It takes other review site ratings and brings them together for comparison while adding its own review on top of them. This may be expanded later to incorporate other topics and media.

This website provides a place where people can post their progress on games and their opinion on them and would help create another friendly community of gamers. If it doesn’t get built gamers will have to use inferior sites that already exist to track their games but don’t provide features that ours will. It also allows users to log the games they’ve played.

Gamers and other individuals who are curious about video games will be the primary audience for this website. It will be especially appealing for vocal gamers that like to share their opinions.

A server to host the website and a team of programmers to make the website will be needed for this project.
